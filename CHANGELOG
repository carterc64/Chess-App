Main features:

  Added the add news component
  
  Routed it to the /admin tag
  
  Added the input form finctionality
  
  Updated newItemModel to have number and reset
  
  Added replaceNews() method to add-news.component.ts
  
  Updated news.service to implement replaceNews()
  
  Implemented replace news to add entries to the database
  
Bonus:
    My cards that I added usually only has 4 at all times. So I implemented a reset feature
    that allows an option to reset either newsList1 or newsList2 and add a card in the process.
    This way you could update all 4 each day with new news and it not be too much of a hassle.
